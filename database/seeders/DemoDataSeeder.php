        <h3>1. Eloquent ORM</h3>
        <p>Laravel\'s Eloquent ORM provides a beautiful, simple ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Artisan Console</h3>
        <p>Artisan is the command-line interface included with Laravel. It provides a number of helpful commands for your use while developing your application.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Blade Templating</h3>
        <p>Blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine provided with Laravel. Unlike other popular PHP templating engines, Blade does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your templates.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Middleware</h3>
        <p>Middleware provides a convenient mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application. For example, Laravel includes a middleware that verifies the user of your application is authenticated.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Routing</h3>
        <p>Laravel\'s routing allows you to route all your application requests to their appropriate controller. The most basic Laravel routes simply accept a URI and a Closure.</p>
        
        <p>These features form the foundation of Laravel development and understanding them will significantly improve your productivity as a developer.</p>';

        <h3>1. Artificial Intelligence Integration</h3>
        <p>AI is becoming increasingly integrated into web development workflows. From automated code generation to intelligent user interfaces, AI is transforming how we build and interact with web applications.</p>
        
        <h3>2. WebAssembly (WASM)</h3>
        <p>WebAssembly is enabling near-native performance in web browsers, opening up new possibilities for complex applications that were previously only possible as desktop software.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h3>
        <p>PWAs continue to gain traction as they bridge the gap between web and mobile applications, providing app-like experiences through web technologies.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Serverless Architecture</h3>
        <p>Serverless computing is changing how we think about backend development, allowing developers to focus on code rather than infrastructure management.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Micro-Frontends</h3>
        <p>This architectural approach allows teams to work independently on different parts of a frontend application, improving scalability and development velocity.</p>

        <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
        <p><strong>Vue.js</strong> is generally considered easier to learn, especially for developers new to JavaScript frameworks. Its template syntax is more familiar to developers coming from HTML/CSS backgrounds.</p>
        <p><strong>React</strong> has a steeper learning curve, particularly due to JSX and the need to understand concepts like state management and lifecycle methods.</p>
        
        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p>Both frameworks offer excellent performance, but they achieve it differently. React uses a virtual DOM, while Vue.js uses a more efficient reactivity system that tracks dependencies automatically.</p>
        
        <h3>Ecosystem and Community</h3>
        <p><strong>React</strong> has a larger ecosystem with more third-party libraries and a massive community. This means more resources, tutorials, and job opportunities.</p>
        <p><strong>Vue.js</strong> has a smaller but growing ecosystem. The community is very supportive and the documentation is excellent.</p>
        
        <h3>When to Choose React</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Building large-scale applications</li>
            <li>Need extensive third-party library support</li>
            <li>Team has strong JavaScript skills</li>
            <li>Want maximum job market opportunities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>When to Choose Vue.js</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rapid prototyping and development</li>
            <li>Team is new to JavaScript frameworks</li>
            <li>Want a more opinionated framework</li>
            <li>Prefer simpler, more intuitive syntax</li>
